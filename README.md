A place for my own technical research and reference.

## Think tank

When creating this project, I didn't know what a think tank was, I just thought of it as a place of research. This project may/may not be a think tank, but it is a place of research and reference. It is pretty much my personal reference to technical details.

This "tank" is pretty out of date (pretty empty) and needs a lot of new data.
